## 771.Jewels and Stones

```


You're given strings J representing the types of stones that are jewels, and S representing the stones you have.  Each character in S is a type of stone you have.  You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

The letters in J are guaranteed distinct, and all characters in J and S are letters. Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".

Example 1:

Input: J = "aA", S = "aAAbbbb"
Output: 3
Example 2:

Input: J = "z", S = "ZZ"
Output: 0
Note:

S and J will consist of letters and have length at most 50.
The characters in J are distinct.
```



###### used hash set and it's O(1) to check if it contains an element.

So the total time complexity will be **O(M+N),** instead of O(MN)

```java
JAVA

public int numJewelsInStones(String J, String S) {
        int res = 0;
        Set setJ = new HashSet();
        for (char j: J.toCharArray()) setJ.add(j);
        for (char s: S.toCharArray()) if (setJ.contains(s)) res++;
        return res;
    }
    


class Solution {
    public int numJewelsInStones(String J, String S) {
        if(S==null || J==null || J.length()==0 || S.length()==0)
            return 0;
        
        int hash[]=new int[256];
        int res=0;
        for(char ch: S.toCharArray())
            hash[ch]++;
        
        for(char ch: J.toCharArray())
            if(hash[ch]>0)
                res+=hash[ch];
        return res;
  }
}
```





⭐**用java的for each是不能达到遍历String的目的的，因为java中的字符串并不是字符数组，c++可**

⭐**用O（MN)方法也可AC，但用hashset快很多**
